## Project Overview

### 1. Heart Failure Prediction
This project focuses on predicting heart failure using several machine learning algorithms, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (Linear and Non-Linear)
- K-Nearest Neighbors

The dataset is preprocessed by normalizing the numerical features and splitting it into training and test sets. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, and the best hyperparameters are selected using grid search.

### 2. K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering
This project compares the performance of K-Means, K-Means++, and hierarchical clustering algorithms on a given dataset. The clustering is performed in both Python and MATLAB to compare their efficiency and results. Techniques used include:
- K-Means and K-Means++
- Hierarchical clustering (Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, Ward)
- SSE (Sum of Square Errors) is used to evaluate the clustering quality.


### 3. Regression Project (Linear and Non-Linear Models)
This project implements various regression techniques to predict housing prices using the provided dataset. The models include:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet
- Polynomial Regression

Data preprocessing steps include filling missing values and normalizing the data. The results show the impact of different regularization methods and polynomial degrees on model performance.
## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- MATLAB
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas
